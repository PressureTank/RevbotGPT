# Pricing

### Preface

Since this project is open source, you don't need to pay ***me*** anything. However, GPT 3 costs money.


### The `model` flag

The `--model` flag represents the models for GPT. You can find the list at [There model page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)

Out of those 6 models, I would only recommend **gpt-3-5-turbo**

Turbo is a GPT3.5 model. It is more powerful than any of GPT3's model, and it is 10x cheaper than GPT3's most powerful model.

### The `max` flag

The `--max` flag represents the max tokens that GPT can use while generating code. If you decrease the flag, it will generate less tokens, thus making it cheaper.
